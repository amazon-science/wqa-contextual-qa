**Coala** is a python package for Contextual Answer Sentence Selection.


Answer Sentence Selection (AS2) is a sub-task of question answering, and it aims at finding the sentence containing the answer for a given input question from a pool of possible candidate sentences (e.g. retrieved from a search engine).

In our contextual AS2 task, we provide models that leverage *contextual* information coming from the documents (or the paragraphs) containing the candidate answers.

If you need further information, you can see our recent papers [1,2].

## Introduction & main use cases

In the following we show the main use cases of this library. You can find additional examples in the `examples` folder.


### Data


Let's start from **data**.

We provide a script to convert SQuAD-2.0 from Machine Reading to AS2.

```
wget https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/train-v2.0.json
wget https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/dev-v2.0.json

python <repository-path>/scripts/convert_squad2.0-to-AS2.py train-v2.0.json squad2.0-train.csv squad2.0-train-docs.json
python <repository-path>/scripts/convert_squad2.0-to-AS2.py dev-v2.0.json squad2.0-dev.csv squad2.0-dev-docs.json
```

The code generates two files for training and two files for development. These files contain AS2 examples (q/a/ctx) and paragraphs to run experiments involving global contexts.


The same can be done to pre-process NQ.

Firstly, download the raw `NQ` dataset [here](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions) (we need raw files to build contextual data).
Then, download `ASNQ`, a version of `NQ` designed for AS2

```
https://d3t7erp6ge410c.cloudfront.net/tanda-aaai-2020/data/asnq.tar
tar -xvf asnq.tar
```

You should find two files in a folder `data/asnq/`, namely `train.tsv` and `dev.tsv`
Now, you can run the script to add context, that is

```
python get_contextual_ASNQ.py <PATH_NQ>/dev data/asnq/dev.tsv asnq-dev-ctx.csv asnq-dev-docs.json
python get_contextual_ASNQ.py <PATH_NQ>/train data/asnq/train.tsv asnq-train-ctx.csv asnq-train-docs.json
```

where `asnq-[train/dev]-ctx.csv` will be the contextual version of ASNQ, and `asnq-[train/dev]-docs.json` will contain the list of full documents.


We consider input observations as a list of dictionaries with fields:

| Field | Description | Mandatory | Example |
| :---- | :---------- | :-------: | :-------|
| `question` | the asked question | yes | Who is Pippo Franco? | 
| `answer`   | a candidate answer sentence | yes | Pippo Franco is an Italian actor |
| `previous` | the sentence that preceeds the candidate | yes | - |
| `successive` | the sentence next to the candidate | yes | He was born in Rome|
| `title` | the title of the document containing the candidate | no | Bibliography of Pippo Franco|
| `doc_id`| an univoke index of the document | no | 32531672372
| `label` | the output class, 1 good answer 0 else |  yes | 1 

If your dataset is stored in a `csv` file with the columns described in the previous table, you can simply read it 

```
from coala.loader import read_dataset
data = read_dataset(path_to_my_file)
```

Note that, in the simple non-contextualized AS2 task you only need the fields `question`, `answer`, and `label`.

We provide specialyzed **datasets** to handle contextual AS2 data, e.g:

```
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer
tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-base')

from coala.datasets import AS2LocalDataset
dataset = AS2LocalDataset(
	data, 				# our q/a/ctx tuples
	tokenizer, 			# the tokenizer
	max_seq_len=256, 	# the maximum length of the encoded text
	task_label='as2')	# as2 or mlm
```

We can also play with our custom **dataloaders** to handle batches and datasets. In the following example, we use a trivial PyTorch dataloader

```
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from coala.utils import batch_padding_as2

my_padding_fn = batch_padding_as2(tokenizer.pad_token_id)
dataloader = DataLoader(
	dataset,
	batch_size  = 64,		# global batch size
	shuffle     = True, 	# this should be False for validation/test dataloader!!!
	num_workers = workers,	# number of threads
	collate_fn  = my_padding_fn)	# custom collate function to create batches
```




### Models


Coala defines several **models** for AS2 based on Transformer architecture. These models can be imported from `coala.models`, and they are summarized in the following table.

| Model Class | Description | Encoded text |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------: |
| `BaseModelForAS2` | The simple model that encodes q/a pairs without context | *[CLS] question [SEP] answer* | 
| `LocalModelForAS2` | An extended model encoding the surrounding sentences of a candidate answer | *[CLS] question [SEP] previous [SEP] answer [SEP] successive* |
| `LocalOrdModelForAS2` | A model with re-ordered local context. Suitable for low-resource scenarios | *[CLS] question [SEP] answer [SEP] previous [SEP] successive* |

The simplest way to use a Contextual AS2 model is starting from pre-trained public checkpoints from HuggingFace

```
from coala.models import LocalModelForAS2
model = LocalModelForAS2('roberta-base')
# or
model = LocalModelForAS2('path_to_model_or_dir')
```



We provide specialyzed wrappers to train our models with a few coding lines. Our wrapper can be configured with various parameters as showed in the following example

```
from coala import AS2Trainer as Trainer
from transformers import get_constant_schedule
import torch

trainer = Trainer(
	model,				# our contextual AS2 model
	optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(self.model.parameters(), lr=1e-5),
	scheduler = get_constant_schedule(self.optimizer),
	epochs    = 5,		# maximum number of epochs
	patience  = 2,		# early stop after 2 epochs
	loss_fct  = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(),
	val_metric= 'p@1',	# the metric used for selecting the best model
	debug     = False,  
	save_path = None,	# the name of the output model
	device    = 'cpu')
```

Now, we are ready to train our contextual AS2 model!

```
trainer = trainer.fit(dataset, dataset_validation)
```

The trainer shows some information each epoch, including the computational time, loss, and validation performance. 
If you specified the parameter `save_path`, you should find a `pt` file in that location containing the fine-tuned model.



### Evaluation 

After training, you can simply load a fine-tuned contextual model with:


```
model = torch.load(my_contextual_path.pt)
```

We can use our `Trainer` to predict the label of new examples (be sure that the parameter `shuffle` of the dataloader is set to `False`)

```
predictions = Trainer(model).predict(dataset_test)
```

For the sake of usability, we provide mechanisms to compute a few metrics and statistics

```
from coala.evaluation import report

labels = dataset_test.labels
questions = dataset_test.questions

print (report(labels, predictions, questions))
>{'examples':2000, 'questions':150, 'AUC': 91.77, 'p@1': 80.23, 'MAP':86.19, ...}
```


We can also print a simple precision-coverage curve

```
from coala.evaluation import precision_curve
precision, ans_rate, thresholds = precision_curve(labels, predictions, questions)
```

The function `precision_curve ` returns the points of the precision/answer-rate curve as triplets with values precision-answerrate-threshold.




## Work in progress
The content of this library represents a small portion of the current research in contextual AS2. 

In the near future, we will add additional modules to cover different types of contexts (including global contexts).
